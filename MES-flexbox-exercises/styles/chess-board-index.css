/* Styling for chessboard.html */

/* Thinking of using space between/around and just alternating rows of divs */

/* Initially attempted to leave body element unstyled & started with a div named #board. However none of the color or styling was being displayed and I don't know why. Reverted back to body element being outermost container */
